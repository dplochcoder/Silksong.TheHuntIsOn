# Silk Regeneration Module

This module allows changing all things related to silk regeneration.

## Silk Hearts

Silk hearts determine how much silk can be auto-generated.

## First Silk Regen Modifier

The first spool of silk regenerates faster than all spools of silk that come after, so it can be modified separately. By default, the spool generates in 1.45 seconds.

## Silk Regen Modifier

By default, all spools after the first spool regenerate in 3.9 seconds.

## Can Farm Silk

If disabled, affected players will not be allowed to collect silk from the environment at all, and must rely on regeneration.
