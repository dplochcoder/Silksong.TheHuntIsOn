# Healing Module

Limit which sources of healing may be utilized by players.

## Bench Heal

If disabled, sitting at a bench will not heal the player.

## Mask Heal

Determine how much healing is granted by completing a full mask (4 mask shards). This can be the default (full heal), no healing, or a heal of 1 mask so that the number of 'missing' masks remains unchanged.

## Ability Heal

If disabled, acquiring new abilities, crests, and silk-hearts will not give full heals.

## Spa Heal

If disabled, bathing in spa water (found in the Flea Caravan, or in the depths of the Citadel) will not heal the player in masks nor silk.
